# Interview challenges

The three main files here, [css-task.html](./css-task.html), [js-task.html](./js-task.html)
and [js-task2.html](./js-task2.html) correspond to same numbered exercises.

### Comments

I used simple HTML files here since the requirements didn't call for anything more complex
like a full React environment; on the contrary, there's a bunch of restrictions on what you
can use for each task, so I kept it as simple as possible.

If you'd like to see something more complex, feel free to have a look at any of my
other repositiories.
