			<h2>Excercise 2: Asynchronous Programming</h2>
			<blockquote>
				The following 5 lines must be included in your solution unmodified.
				<pre>
const timer = ms =&gt; logName =&gt; setTimeout(console.log, ms, `${logName} called`);</pre
				>
				<pre>
const log1 = timer(2500);
const log2 = timer(1500);
const log3 = timer(500);
      </pre
				>
				<p>
					Use the 3 functions above to implement a solution where the console
					outputs each function in the order that they're listed above.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<h3>Rules for Exercise 2</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					You may modify the timer function as long as you maintain the given
					order of arguments and pass the ms argument to setTimeout.
				</li>
				<li>You may not modify how the 3 log functions above are called.</li>
				<li>
					You must call the log functions in the order that they're listed
					above. i.e.: `log1` must be called before `log2`, which must be called
					before `log3`.
				</li>
				<li>You may not import any libraries to assist with your solution.</li>
				<li>
					You may use any ECMAScript transpiler so that you can write your
					solution in modern ECMAScript.
				</li>
